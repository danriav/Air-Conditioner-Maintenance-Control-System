# Air Conditioner Maintenance Control System

## 📌 Overview
This project provides a digital tool developed in **Microsoft Excel with VBA** to manage air conditioning units at the **Instituto Tecnológico de Colima**.  
It allows registering equipment, tracking preventive and corrective maintenance, and updating equipment status and location.  

The goal of the project is to solve the lack of a structured maintenance log and to improve efficiency in identifying, locating, and updating air conditioning units.

## ❗ Problem Statement
The maintenance department currently faces the following issues:
- ❌ No digital log exists to record preventive and corrective maintenance.  
- ❌ The search and update process for equipment is slow and not structured.  
- ❌ Air conditioners are difficult to identify by serial number only, requiring additional identifiers.  

---

## 📊 Results & Impact
- 📉 Reduced paper usage by **90%**, making the process more eco-friendly.  
- ⚡ Improved maintenance logging efficiency by an estimated **70%**.  
- 📂 Enabled historical data tracking to monitor performance changes in air conditioners over time.
